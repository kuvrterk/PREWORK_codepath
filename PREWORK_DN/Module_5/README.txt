1. Question 3. There are different programming languages due to the fact that each one
serves a purpose for a specifitic task that certain lanuages cannot perform. C/C++ cannot be perform
for web develoment while javascript cannot be use to write programs for embedded devices. Each language has its own
technologies like spring for java or skilearn for python which help ease different take for that language.

2. The number one thing I want to learn in this boot camp is learning the foundmentals of all the topics and technologies we would learn and decide which
of those fields interest me the most and decide which part of cyber secuirty I want to go. From looking at the course schedule I'll say that most all of the courses interest me
especially network secuirty and offensice secuirty. I try to learn pen testing and learning the technology that comes with it, but it's a hard part of secuirty to get into when you
don't have someone to properlly teach you the basics to advanced yout skills afterwards. Second is network secuirty due to the fact that I love networking as a subject and I just understand it
easily while I find it interesting. So learning how to secuirty it from a more engineering side rather then a technican which I'm use to and learning how to secure it; that would be fun
learning about it. As someone who would be going into the secuirty field after getting my degree; this boot camp is definitely going to help my career by getting first hand experience 
and knowedgle in tools and conecpts, while being confident in my skills from this boot camp when interviewing for a secuirty position and bring all that I learn into the job.
